# 🧠 Project Title

**Digital Behavior and Mental Health Risk Across Age Groups – A Global Study with Teen Focus**

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Digital devices and social media use are on the rise, especially among teenagers. Excessive use is now correlated with sleep disorders, anxiety and emotional distress. However, most data only track screen time without connecting it to real mental health outcomes.

This project aims to bridge that gap by combining global usage statistics with real-time emotional signals from social platforms to uncover mental health risk patterns. Special focus will be placed on teenagers — the age group often most affected but least understood.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Map digital usage across countries and age groups  
- Extract mental health–related emotional content from social media  
- Correlate emotional patterns with sleep and health stats  
- Identify high-risk populations and countries  
- Conduct in-depth analysis of teenage behavior and mental health patterns  

---

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. Which age groups show the highest screen time and poorest sleep hygiene?  
2. Are negative emotional expressions more common among younger social media users?  
3. What are the most prevalent emotional signals among teenagers online?  
4. Which countries show the highest digital mental health risk for teens?  
5. How can NGOs and public health groups use this data for mental health interventions?
