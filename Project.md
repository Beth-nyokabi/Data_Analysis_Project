# 📘 Gender Representation in Politics: A Global Perspective

## 🧠 Project Background

Despite progress in gender equality, **women remain underrepresented in politics** globally. This project aims to shed light on where we are, how far we've come and which countries are leading—or lagging—in ensuring that their legislatures reflect their populations.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

This project investigates the **extent and evolution of gender representation in national parliaments**, focusing on the gap between women's share of the population and their presence in political office.

It explores:
- Trends in women’s representation from 1945 to 2018
- The gender makeup of current parliamentary speakers
- Early insights from the June 2025 parliamentary elections

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. How has the percentage of women in national parliaments evolved globally and by region?
2. What structural or regional patterns emerge in female political leadership?
3. How are women represented in speaker roles across different parliamentary systems?
4. Are certain countries or systems (unicameral vs bicameral) more inclusive?
5. Has there been meaningful change in the 2025 elections compared to historical trends?
