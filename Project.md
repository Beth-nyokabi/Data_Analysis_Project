# 📘 Gender Representation in Politics: A Global Perspective

## 🧠 Project Background

Despite progress in gender equality, **women remain underrepresented in politics** globally. This project aims to shed light on where we are, how far we've come and which countries are leading—or lagging—in ensuring that their legislatures reflect their populations.
