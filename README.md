# 👩‍⚖️ Gender Representation in Politics: A Global Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the historical and contemporary state of **women’s representation in political office** around the world. Using datasets from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it aims to identify trends, gaps and progress in achieving gender parity in politics.

We analyze:

- The gender composition of current parliamentary speakers (2025)
- Gender representation in the most recent (June 2025) parliamentary elections
