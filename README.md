# 📊 Gender Inequality in Politics: A Global Analysis

## 🔍 What Does This Project Do?

This project investigates **gender representation in global political institutions**, focusing on:

- 🏛️ Percentage of women in parliaments (1945–2018)
- 🗳️ Women elected in recent elections (2025)
- 🎙️ Women in parliamentary leadership roles (speakers)

It addresses the problem of **underrepresentation of women in politics** and provides a data-driven lens to evaluate progress, stagnation and inequality over time and across countries.

**Who it's for:**  
Researchers, policymakers, activists, educators and citizens concerned with gender equity and democratic governance.

## 💡 Why This Project? What Inspired It?

Despite decades of advocacy, **women still face systemic exclusion from political power**. News headlines often celebrate “firsts” — first female speaker, first woman elected — yet full equality remains elusive.

This project was inspired by the desire to:

- Uncover **long-term patterns** in women’s political representation
- Combine **historical and real-time data**
- Create **accessible, visual, and impactful insights**
- Help **fill the gap** between data availability and data usability

## ✨ Features & Outcomes

- 📈 **Historical Trends**: Women in parliaments from 1945 to 2018  
- 🌍 **Global Comparison**: Country-level analysis by year and chamber  
- 🗳️ **2025 Elections**: Gender outcomes from recent elections  
- 🎙️ **Leadership Gap**: Gender of parliamentary speakers  
- 📊 Visualizations built with **Python (VSCode)** and **Tableau Dashboards**

**What users can do:**

- Explore gender gaps in political participation
- Compare countries and regions across time
- View trends in leadership representation
- Use insights for research, reports, or advocacy

## 📊 Key Findings(Assumptions)

- 🐢 Progress has been **slow and uneven** since 1945  
- 🎙️ Women are **significantly underrepresented** in speaker roles  
- 🗳️ **Recent elections in 2025** show **marginal gains** at best  
- 🌐 Countries with gender quotas, higher development, or equality policies tend to **perform better**

> 🔎 **Takeaway**: Representation is improving — but not fast enough. Leadership gaps are especially persistent and require structural change.
