# 📊 Gender Inequality in Politics: A Global Analysis

## Project Overview

### 🔍 What Does This Project Do?
This project investigates **gender representation in global political institutions**, focusing on:

- 🏛️ Percentage of women in parliaments (1945–2018)
- 🎙️ Women in parliamentary leadership roles (speakers)

It addresses the problem of **underrepresentation of women in politics** and provides a data-driven lens to evaluate progress, stagnation and inequality over time and across countries.

**Who it's for:**  
Researchers, policymakers, activists, educators and citizens concerned with gender equity and democratic governance.

## Goal

### 💡 Why This Project? 
Despite decades of advocacy, **women still face systemic exclusion from political power**. News headlines often celebrate “firsts” — first female speaker, first woman elected — yet full equality remains elusive.

### What Inspired It?
This project was inspired by the desire to:

- Uncover **long-term patterns** in women’s political representation
- Combine **historical and real-time data**
- Create **accessible, visual, and impactful insights**
- Help **fill the gap** between data availability and data usability

## ✨ Features & Outcomes

- 📈 Decades of Data: Analyzed gender representation in parliaments from 1945 to 2018, uncovering long-term trends in women’s political participation. 
- 🌍 Regional & Global Comparison: Explored disparities across countries and continents, highlighting where gender gaps persist or progress has been made.  
- 🧭 Chamber Analysis: Compared representation in upper vs lower houses, revealing how parliamentary structure influences gender balance.  
- 🎙️ Leadership Disparity: Investigated the gender of parliamentary speakers, exposing gaps in top-level political authority. 
- 📊 Data Visualizations: Built engaging, interactive visuals using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) hosted on a dynamic web interface.

**What users can do:**

- Explore gender gaps in political participation
- Compare countries and regions across time
- View trends in leadership representation
- Use insights for research, reports, or advocacy

## 📊 Some Key Findings

- 🐢 Progress has been **slow and uneven** since 1945  
- 🎙️ Women are **significantly underrepresented** in speaker roles    
- 🌐 Countries with gender quotas, higher development, or equality policies tend to **perform better**

> 🔎 **Takeaway**: Representation is improving — but not fast enough. Leadership gaps are especially persistent and require structural change.

## 🛠️ What’s Next?

Planned features and analysis extensions:

- 📊 Join with external datasets: education, gender equality index, HDI, quota laws
- 🧠 Predictive models for gender parity forecasts
- 🌐 Interactive web dashboard for public exploration
- 💬 Sentiment/media analysis of how women politicians are portrayed
- 📍 Region-specific focus (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia)
