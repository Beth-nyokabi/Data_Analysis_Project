# 📊 Project Title

**Global Digital Behavior & Mental Health Risk Patterns Across Age Groups**

---

## 📌 Overview

This project investigates the intersection between digital device usage, emotional signals from social media and mental health trends across various age groups and countries. It integrates structured and unstructured data sources to identify global risk patterns — with a dedicated deep-dive analysis into the teenager population (10–17 years old).

The final output includes a comprehensive dashboard, sentiment analysis visualizations and insight reports aimed at helping public health authorities, NGOs and educational institutions design better mental health interventions.
